This project is a React-based notes application developed as part of a comparative study of modern frontend frameworks. The application allows users to create, edit, delete, search, and filter notes. All data is stored locally in the browser. 

The features of the app:
• Notes can be created with a title, text content, optional tags, and optional file attachments
• Notes can be edited and deleted, with all changes reflected immediately in the UI
• A search bar allows real-time filtering of notes based on title and content
• Tag-based filtering allows narrowing down notes by selected tags
• All notes are persisted using browser local storage, so data remains after page reloads
• File attachments are handled on the client side and associated with individual notes

To run the application locally, Node.js and npm must be installed on the system. The node_modules folder is  not included in the repository and must be installed locally.
Instructions for setting up:
• Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine
• Navigate into the project folder
• Install dependencies using: npm install
• Start the development server: npm run dev
• Open the application in the browser using the local development URL provided by Vite
